### Write-Up:
*  This web app implements a mini-version of scrabble. It seems to have all the features that were listed in the rubric except for the ability for the dragged pieces to revert back when dropped on a slot that is not adjacent to already present tiles. I could not figure out how to fix that. Other than that though I think it has all necessary functions. It can get replenish tiles when they are running low, add the current word's score to a running total, and it can also reset the board at anytime. Doesn't include any extra credit portions done.
